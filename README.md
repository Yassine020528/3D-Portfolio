# 🖥️ Yassine's 3D Interactive Portfolio
> "Why build a simple portfolio when you can build a computer?"

Welcome to my personal workspace, digitized. This project isn't just a gallery of my work, it's a high-performance 3D environment built with React and Three.js that puts you in the driver's seat of my creative process.

## 🌟 The Experience
✔️Immersive 3D Room: A custom-designed workspace featuring realistic lighting, shadows, and smooth camera rigging.

✔️Functional Virtual OS: Click on the computer screen to enter a fully interactive web-based operating system.

✔️Retro Terminal: A functional bash-style terminal supporting commands like help, about, and projects.

✔️Dynamic Themes: Toggle between Dark, Light, Hacker, and Cyberpunk modes within the virtual settings.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
### Core
React.js: For component-based UI and state management.

Three.js / React-Three-Fiber: Powering the 3D engine and scene rendering.

Drei: To simplify 3D helpers like OrbitControls and GLTF loading.
